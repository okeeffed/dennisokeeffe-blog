I had a couple of requests the other night (including from the creator!) to update my Snowpack with Create React App post to use both the latest version of Snowpack and Create React App.

[Request One](https://twitter.com/fredkschott/status/1320745141833879552)

[Request Two](https://twitter.com/runjep/status/1320750070015418369)

Check out the [updated post](https://blog.dennisokeeffe.com/blog/2020-07-19-cra-with-snowpack/)!

The final project can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/okeeffed/cra-4-snowpack)
