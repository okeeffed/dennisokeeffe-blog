No Rules Rules is a book by Erin Meyer and Reed Hastings that dives into the culture of Netflix and decisions that they made to attract, retain and move on what they refer to as "high-density talent".

Prior to reading this book, I had always been fascinated by Netflix and their approach to culture ever since listening to an [NPR podcast](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/435583328). After hearing that podcast for the first time, I was absolutely smitten by the story of Patty McCord and her time being known as the queen of goodbyes. 

It was a podcast I had shared over and over to friends whom, most of the time, were unsure if they could agree with the approach and Netflix's onboarding deck ([here is an outdated version](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)). An onboarding deck which itself was touted by Sandy Sandberg as "the most important document to come out of Silicon Valley".

Today's post is a personal reflection after completing around 70% of the book. There is enough audacious content to split this book review into multiple parts if I really wanted to get into the nitty gritty! My approach to this will be to layout some of the real "wow" moments that stood out for me, an open and earnest conversation about how I believe it applies to my day-to-day job at [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/), and the actions that I will be taking at work this week upon reflection of my own career.
