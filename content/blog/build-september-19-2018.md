# Build Series #3: Pexel Japan

Published: September 20th 2018

In earnest, today was pretty busy between work and outside commitments... so I ended up taking a quick route with the final build after work today and forgot to use the new things I was working on.

The images themselves come from Pexel which I rediscovered thanks to Product Hunt and Pexel release a mobile version which ranked in the top 5 product releases for the day. Highly recommend as another option if you need some image placeholders. The theme was Japan -- my favourite holiday destination.

The site ended up reusing some of the split column components I built on the train in previous days but I also added in some ipsum blog pages to sit as placeholders to make sure that today's build wasn't a single page website like the previous two.
